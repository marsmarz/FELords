# W2D1 - Activity 05: Animals Array

## W2D1 - Activity 05: Animals Array

* In this activity, you will have to examine some code containing/referencing arrays before predicting what the output will be and what certain lines of code are doing.

* **File:**

    * `10-ArraysActivity/Unsolved/arrays-activity.html`

* **Instructions:**

    * With a partner, take a few moments to look over the following code.

    * Above each `console.log()` write a comment "predicting" what you think the output will be.

* **Hint:**

    * Comments are the grayed lines that begin with `//`. These lines are ignored by JavaScript, and they allow you to explain your code.
    
* **Extension:**

    * Console.log the animals array
    
    * Log the last element of the array
