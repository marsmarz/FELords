## W2D1 - Activity 02: Pizza Console

* In this activity, you will be modifying the previous activity from using the `alert()` function to instead use `console.log()` so the output is less intrusive.

* **Files**

    * `04-PizzaConsole/Unsolved/pizza-variables-2.html`

* **Instructions**

    * Using the file sent to you as a guide, modify the code so that it uses `console.log` instead of alerts to display messages.

    * With a partner, discuss the difference between using `console.log` and `alert`.
